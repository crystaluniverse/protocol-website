# Welcome! Let me take you on a journey

**Protocol.me is the easiest way to program on the crystal twin and the beauty of it all is: It does almost all the work for you!**

Fully powered by the [ThreeFold Grid](https://threefold.io) there is nothing you need to do. The Crystal Twin uses the _autonomous layer_ which makes our work as developers much smoother as resource and memory allocation is been done for us, in fully peer-2-peer fashion. 

## Developing a truely peer-2-peer experience has never been easier!
